Nawabari is the custom repo mirrorer for [Strelizia Apus](https://github.com/ProjectA-RP/strelizia_apus) that will mirror the code from framework repo to the [main project repo](https://github.com/ProjectA-RP/ProjectA)

In the [Project A](https://github.com/ProjectA-RP) we used our custom framework called "Strelizia Apus" that located at her self repo (isolate from main repo). But the main repo also need the framework, What we do ?

We push commit to the "Strelizia Apus" repo and the main repo too. That so tedious right ? So this thing was created
